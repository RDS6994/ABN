ABN AMRO Assessment
Author: Rens Sturm

Project description: the files in this zip represent my answers to the assessment send by Richard Dada.
The assessment exists of three parts: 1) Determine whether there is a relationship beween GDP and the average 
age a programmer begins coding. 2) Create a REST API. 3) Create a pivot table with the count of programmers in 
the 3 most popular programming languages per country. 

I started with the third assignment and created some tables I used in the first assignment. Please start reviewing at 
assignment three. 

The SQL files can be opened using Microsoft SQL Server 2019. The Python files can be opened with any python IDE
like Google Collaborate. 

I have used the following external datasets:
List of countries in the European Union: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/9/9f/Country_Codes_and_Names.xlsx
Real GDP per capita per country: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=EU
